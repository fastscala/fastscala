# 🚀 FastScala

Welcome to **FastScala**!: quickly create complex web applications, leveraging Scala's type safety, modularity, reusability while ensuring security! 🌟

## 🌍 Overview

**FastScala** is a modern web framework that enables secure, anonymous callbacks from the client-side to the server-side, allowing developers to build complex webapps almost 100% in Scala. By leveraging the type-safety and power of Scala, FastScala enables the rapid development of complex components like forms, tables, and modals, all with minimal effort. This framework is designed to handle increasingly complex interfaces while maintaining simplicity and performance. All this without sacrificing security!

### Why FastScala? 🤔

- 💻 **Code in Scala**: Build your entire web application in Scala, harnessing the full power of the language.
- 🔐 **Anonymous and Secure Callbacks**: Keep client-server communication secure and simple.
- ⚡ **Quick Development**: Build complex interfaces like forms, tables, and modals with just a few lines of code.
- ⚒️ **Reusable Components**: Create reusable web components easily and efficiently.
- 🔒 **Strong Security**: Designed with security in mind, ensuring safe communication between the client and the server.
